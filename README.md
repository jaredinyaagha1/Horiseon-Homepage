# Horiseon-Homepage

## Description
### This webpage is a small project that I did in order to practice building websites using HTML and CSS. In this project I am demonstrating my ability to analyze code and convert it into a more efficient version of itself while still producing similar results.
### In addition to improving the code's execution, I have added a couple features to improve the overall accessibility of the page, such as alternate descriptions for the icon and image elements on the page

## Process
### To start, I was given an html and css file and asked to make them operate more efficiently. In order to do this, I started by analyzing both codes to determine if there were any parts of the code that could be consolidated into less data. In the HTML code I noticed that there were no semantic tags so I chose to add more fitting tags to the elements of the webpage. Instead of using div to declare my elements I have implemented more descriptive tags such as 'main, nav, section, and aside'. I also removed a few tags that I deemed unnecessary, then ensured that the webpage appeared the same as before. Lastly, I have included a concise and descriptive title to the HTML code within the head element for future reader comprehension.
